                To be eligible for a return, the item must be in its original condition, unused, and in its original packaging.

                To initiate a return, please also provide the reason for the return. We will provide you with a return shipping label and instructions. You will be responsible for paying the return shipping costs.

                Once we receive the returned item, we will inspect it and process a refund within 7 business days. Refunds will be credited back to the original payment method used for the purchase.

                Send the email to our returns portal customer@anoshe.com with your order number (found on your order confirmation) and email address and let us know what you want to return and why. You can return more than one order or package at the same time, as long as you send with all relevant return slips in the package.


                You do not need to fill out the paper return form but send it in your package. If you are returning a defective or incorrect item, please complete and send the return form on the delivery note instead.


                Once your return is registered in the portal, you will be asked by email to select one of the options below to complete your return.
